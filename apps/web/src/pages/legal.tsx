              Network”), including but not limited to Ethereum, which allow users to
              create and deploy Nouns-model DAOs. The Protocol is maintained by Builder
              DAO and the Builder developer community. Zora does not control or operate
              the Protocol. Rather, the Interface simplifies interaction with the Protocol
              to provide a user-friendly method to create and manage DAOs through the

            <Paragraph mt="x2">
              Deployments on other blockchain networks typically rely on a series of smart
              contracts to transfer crypto assets from one blockchain network to another.
              As a result, before you are able to use the Protocol or the Services via a
              Supported Network other than Ethereum, you may need to “bridge” the crypto
              assets held within your Wallet on the Ethereum blockchain to the Supported
              Network that you intend to utilize. This process is known as “bridging” and
              the smart contracts that permit bridging are each known as a “bridge.”
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph mt="x2">
              Crypto assets that have not been bridged to a Supported Network cannot be
              used in transactions on such Supported Network. Similarly, crypto assets
              that have been bridged to a Supported Network cannot be used in transactions
              on the Ethereum blockchain until such crypto assets have been “withdrawn”
              (this process is known as “withdrawing”) from the Supported Network. The
              crypto assets that you bridge to a Supported Network will appear in your
              Wallet on the Supported Network, but will not appear in your Wallet on the
              Ethereum blockchain.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph mt="x2">
              If you attempt to bridge any crypto assets that are not supported by a
              bridge designed for a Supported Network, you may destroy or irretrievably
              lose access to such crypto assets. You own, control, and are responsible for
              all crypto assets held in and bridged via your Wallet and Zora is not liable
              or responsible for any crypto assets that are destroyed or irretrievably
              lost by users through the bridging and withdrawing process.

              transfer crypto assets from Ethereum to Supported Networks built on the OP
              Stack, available to the public at
              https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism (collectively “OP Stack

              Third-party developers may release third-party bridges that allow users to
              bridge crypto assets, from the Ethereum blockchain to and from OP Stack
              Networks (“Third-Party Bridges”). Third-Party Bridges may allow you to: 1)
              withdraw funds from OP Stack Networks to Ethereum Mainnet; and 2) access
              your crypto assets at a faster rate than the Builder Bridge as Third-Party
              Bridges may offer different deposit times. Third-Party Bridges may also
              charge you additional or different transaction or “gas” fees than the
              Builder Bridge. You must exercise caution when accessing and using
              Third-Party Bridges. Once your crypto assets are locked in a Third-Party
              Bridge, control over such Third-Party Bridge is typically with the
              third-party developer or the smart contract itself. At no point in time will
              we be liable to you for any loss involving a Third-Party Bridge, have the
              ability to exercise control over any Third Party Bridge, or assist you if
              your crypto assets get locked in a Third-Party Bridge. The applicable
              service provider for the Third-Party Bridge is solely responsible for the
              crypto assets you use in connection with a Third-Party Bridge and any
              transaction that is facilitated via such Third-Party Bridge whether
              successful, incomplete, subject to dispute, or otherwise.
